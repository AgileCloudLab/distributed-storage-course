\section*{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item Python 3 is installed on your computer (preferably 3.6 or newer)
\item You have a basic understanding of Python and you are able to write Python code. It is okay if you need to look up things sometimes
\item You are familiar with the material of Lecture 1
\item Reommended reading before the lab: \href{https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/sockets.html}{Python socket programming howto}
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
In this lab, we will learn how to use \textbf{sockets} in Python to send messages and files between a simple client and a server, locally. We will extend the example TCP server that was introduced in the lecture, and implement the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item Socket Server and Client: text message
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Both on same machine: use localhost
  \item Client sends message, e.g., name
  \item Server receives message, replies: "I have received: " \& the message. Ends connection
  \item Server reports IP and message in the terminal
  \item Test with colleagues: Use your client to send data to their server
  \end{itemize}
\item Socket Server and Client: File transmission
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Instead of a message, transmit contents of a file and save as file in the server
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
